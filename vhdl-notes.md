## Overview

* **Combinational** logic, in which the output signals depend only on the current input signals
* **Sequential logic**, in which the output depends both on current input and the past history of inputs. In other words,      sequential logic is combinational logic with memory.

## FPGA

* The Virtex II FPGA:
  * A **logic cell** consists of a **lookup table**, a **flip flop**, and connection to adjacent cells.
  * The lookup table uses combinatorial logic to implement a **4-input expression** (and, or, nand, addition, etc.)
  * A **logic slice** consists of **2 logic cells**.
    * Xilinx counts closer to 2.25 logic cells per slice because they can do more per configurable logic block (CLB) than other architectures.
* A **CLB** consists of **4 slices**, but differs between different FPGAs.
  * This combined architecture gives benefits in the final system such as increased performance of logic execution.
* It is important to note that the efficiency of a gate in an FPGA is not equivalent to that of a gate in an ASIC.
  * For example, a 1M gate FPGA is roughly equivalent to a 100K gate ASIC.

## LUTs

[Explanation of LUTs](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/169532/what-is-an-lut-in-fpga)

Basically though, just a truth table (X inputs, X outputs) that can generate a function you want - think Karnaugh maps, binary rules etc.

## Reset

Two types:

  1. Synchronous
  2. Asynchronous

What is used depends on your design.

* Reset will be buffered from a reset buffer tree, it is wise to limit the amount of logic the reset must traverse
once it reaches the local logic.

### Synchronous

* Usually recommended since your design can be a completely synchronous circuit
* +Filters out the small glitches that can occur
* -May need a pulse stretcher on the reset to make it edge triggered, consider multi-clock designs
* -If the reset input isn't asserted on a clk edge, then the reset may be missed
  * If the design disables the clk to save power (eg. a processor), likewise the reset will be as well.

### Asynchronous

* Due to varying network skews this can lead to different FFs coming out of reset on different clock cycles giving an indeterminate behavior.
  * For a large reset network with a huge fan-out we can assume the network skew to be considerable - which further worsens the situation and increases the likelihood of problems.
* -They are asynchronous, both at the assertion and at the de-assertion of the reset. The assertion is a non issue, the **de-assertion** is the issue. If the asynchronous reset is released at or near the active clock edge of a flip-flop, the
output of the flip-flop could go **metastable** and thus the reset state of the ASIC could be lost.
* -Asynchronous reset can have, depending on its source, is spurious resets due to noise or glitches on the board or system reset. A different but similar problem exists for synchronous resets if these spurious reset pulses occur near a clock edge, the flip-flops can still go metastable (but this is true of any data input that violates setup requirements).

#### Reset times

* **Recovery time**: minimum time that an asynchronous control input pin must be stable **before** the next active clock edge transition. Like `T(su)`
* **Removal time**: minimum time that an asynchronous control input pin must be stable **before** being deasserted and after the previous active clock transition. Like `T(h)`

```text
reset ________________
           | Recovery |______

clk                    _______
      ________________|
```

### Removal Timing Check

  A removal timing check ensures that there is adequate time between an active clock edge and the release of an asynchronous control signal. The check ensures that the active clock edge has no effect because the asynchronous
control signal remains active until removal time after the active clock edge.

  In other words, the asynchronous control signal is released (becomes inactive) well after the active clock edge so that the clock edge can have no
effect

### Recovery Timing Check

  A recovery timing check ensures that there is a minimum amount of time between the asynchronous signal becoming inactive and the next active clock edge. In other words, this check ensures that after the asynchronous signal becomes inactive, there is adequate time to recover so that the next active clock edge can be effective.

  For example, consider the time between an asynchronous reset becoming inactive and the clock active edge of a flip-flop. If the active clock edge occurs too soon after the release of reset, the state of the flip-flop may be unknown.

## Delays

* **Setup time:** `T(su)` is the minimum amount of time a synchronous data input should be held **STEADY BEFORE** the clock'event so that the data input is **reliably** sampled by the clock event.
* **Hold time:** `T(h)` is the minimum amount of time a synchronous data input should be held **STEADY AFTER** the clock event so that the data input   is **reliably** sampled by the clock event.
  * Hold time is usually zero or **negative**; if neg, that means the data input can change **before** the clk edge and still have a stable output.
* **Propagation delays:** `T(p)` is the delay for 0 -> 1 or 1 -> 0 for example, and these delays may not be symmetrical!

As usual, a diagram does wonders:

### Metastability

When two inputs, such as data and clock or clock and reset, are **changing at about the same time**.

* The solution is to reduce either `T(h)` or `T(su)` but can't reduce **both** simultaneously.
  * Can be achieved by chaining two flip-flops together so either the `T(su)` or `T(h)` increases therefore reducing the probability of metastability

### Minimum Clock period

So by summing up the `T(su)`, `T(h)` and `T(p)`; there will be a **minimum clock period** `T(min)` and therefore a **maximum frequency** `F(max)` for a particular circuit design.

Example:

```text
T(su) = 0.6 ns
T(h)  = 0.4 ns
0.8 ns >= T(p) <= 1.0 ns

T(delay) of k-input gate = 1 + 0.1k ns

T(min) = 1/F(max) : critical path

-- Look at max frequency
T(min) = MAX{T(p)} + T(NOT GATE) + T(su)
       = 1.0       + 1.1         + 0.6
       = 2.7 ns
F(max) = 370 MHz

-- Check for hold time violations; if T(min) < T(h), then we can't achieve the
-- required T(h) for stable signals
T(min delay) = MIN{T(p)} + T(NOT GATE)
             = 0.8       + 1.1
             = 1.9 ns > T(h) = 0.4 ns
No violation!

```

## Clock skew

![Clock Skew](https://i.imgur.com/V7apDH9.png)

* **Positive clock skew** means that the clock arriving a little slower in a counter-flip flop for example. This allows 'extra' time when calculating the critical path for a certain flip-flop.
* A **negative clock skew**, i.e. clock arriving earlier at `Q3` than at `Q0` – `Q2` would have the opposite effect of lengthening the clock period & *reducing* clock frequency

## Latches

Okay, there are 2 huge differences here:

  1. Normal (SR) latch
  2. Gated latches
  3. Both are asynchronous circuits

### Normal latches

* These are fucked, you **don't** want to ever write these!
* It holds a bit value **BUT** its final state of the output depends on **oscillatory behavior** that depends on the speed of the gates and wires!

### Gated latches

* The have a `clk` input that has a condition `if = '1'` then, output assignment. These aren't edge triggered!
* Like flip flops, they have implied memory.
* **SR latch** has an **illegal** condition since in its truth table, it has has outputs (Q, Q') that **aren't** complements of one another!
  * S = set, R = reset; so yes, it is a 3 input LUT
* **D latch** has no reset so it's like a D flip flip but while `clk=1`, output state **can** change.

Below is the timing differences:

![D latch and D flip flop](https://i.imgur.com/DusJCJe.png?1)

```vhdl
-- Example of implied memory, latch
-- equal is assigned at based on speed of gates + wires
-- so oscillatory behavior may have 'glitches'
process (A,B)
begin
    if A = B then
        equal <= '1';
    end if;
end process;
```

#### Gated SR latch

* Can be made with OR gates or NAND gates; the latter uses less transistors and has the same characteristic table.
* These are fucked since it has an undefined output when `S = R = 1` - see last row since Q, q' aren't complements

| clk | S | R | Q(t+1)   |
| --- |---|---| -------  |
| 0   | x | x | no change|
| 1   | 0 | 0 | no change|
| 1   | 0 | 1 | 0        |
| 1   | 1 | 0 | 1        |
| 1   | 1 | 1 | x        |

#### Gated D Latch

Holds value and has no restricted combination

|clk | D | Q       |
|--- |---|---      |
| 0  | X |no change|
| 1  | 0 | 0       |
| 1  | 1 | 1       |

```vhdl
-- Example of Gated D latch
-- NOTE that it's not edge triggered!
-- Sensitivity list is VERY important, if you miss the input D
-- synthesis tools will fuck up your latch
process (clk, D)
begin
    if clk = '1' then
        Q <= D;
    end if;
end process;
```

## Flip flops

* Like latches, its outputs change when `clk=1` but are edge sensitive!
* Positive edge triggered D flip flops saves some gates and an inverter.

### D Flip Flop

* Synchronous circuits
* You can also have an async reset

Values changes only on **rising** edges and holds value otherwise.

| Clock       | D | Qnext |
|-------------|---|-------|
| Rising edge | 0 | 0     |
| Rising edge | 1 | 1     |
| Non-Rising  | X | Q     |

```vhdl
-- Example of D flip flop
process (clk)
begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
        Q <= D;
    end if;
end process;
```

### T Flip flop

`Q` changes when `rising_edge(clk)` and when `T = 1`

| T | Q(t+1) |
|---|------- |
| 0 | Q(t)   |
| 1 | Q'(t)  |

## Shift registers

### Serial-in and serial-out (SISO)

Useful for buffering data serially

```text
Essentially if you had a 4 bit reg. with 0000
Shift in D = 1, 0, 1, 1
After 4 clk cycles, reg. with 1011
```

### Serial-in, parallel-out (SIPO)

You get the output of the reg. in 'real-time' and is useful converting serial input to parallel data.

## Parallel-in, Parallel-out (PIPO)

```vhdl
if rising_edge(clk) then
    if L = '1' then
        Q <= R ;        -- load in data parallel
    else
        Q(0) <= Q(1) ;  -- shift data to right
        Q(1) <= Q(2) ;
        Q(2) <= Q(3) ;
        Q(3) <= w ;
    end if;
```

## FSM

### Moore

* Output is purely a function of the **present state**. **Not** dependent upon inputs.
* eg. counting number of D = 1 (input) on a clock edge, updated AFTER current clock cycle, doesn't care about current INPUT

### Mealy

* Output is also a function of its **current inputs**.
* eg. counting number of D = 1 (input) on a clock edge, updated in 'real-time'

## Tri State Buffers

![Active high](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kiran_Kumar207/publication/318295016/figure/fig4/AS:513915571195911@1499538428940/Tri-state-buffers-with-active-high-and-low-controls.png)

```vhdl
Y <= A when (EN = '0') else 'Z';

-- for multiple buffers in parallel
tristate : for i in 0 to N generate
begin
    Y(i) <= A(i) when EN(i) = '1' else 'Z';
end generate tristate;
```

* useful for replacing a MUX - eg. you have multiple data and selecting which to go on bus, you can disable ALL, and not just one.
* Z = high impedance: influence on the rest of the circuit is removed, and the circuit node will be "floating" if no other circuit element determines its state
* also keeps the same current into parallel (split into 4 eg)

## Binary operations

### Multiplication

```text
// just like normal multiplication

    1101    // 13
    0101 x  // 5
    ----
    1101    // consider these as partial sums eg. p0
   0000-    // p1
  1101--    // p2
  ------
 1000001    // 65

 ----------------------------------------------------------

 // just do a partial sum

 // if a[0] = 0; 00000000 & b[7:0] = same as multiplying by 0
 p0[7:0] = a[0] × b[7:0] = {8{a[0]}} & b[7:0]
 p1[7:0] = a[1] × b[7:0] = {8{a[1]}} & b[7:0]
 p2[7:0] = a[2] × b[7:0] = {8{a[2]}} & b[7:0]
 p3[7:0] = a[3] × b[7:0] = {8{a[3]}} & b[7:0]
 p4[7:0] = a[4] × b[7:0] = {8{a[4]}} & b[7:0]
 p5[7:0] = a[5] × b[7:0] = {8{a[5]}} & b[7:0]
 p6[7:0] = a[6] × b[7:0] = {8{a[6]}} & b[7:0]
 p7[7:0] = a[7] × b[7:0] = {8{a[7]}} & b[7:0]

 // where {8{a[0]}} means repeating a[0] (the 0th bit of a) 8 times

 answer = p0 + (p1 << 1) + (p2 << 2) ...

  ----------------------------------------------------------

  // In HW

  100 // multiplicand
  011 // multiplier
  ---
  xxx // product
```
